After both corners are secured, the clamps lift the sheet to a spreading clamp that stretches it flat before depositing it onto a vacuum deposit bar. This deposit bar then releases the sheet onto the in-feed conveyor, sending it directly into the ironer.

Without this, the burner may not ignite.\n\n3. **Inspect Safety Systems:**\n   - Check all safety systems and monitoring elements:\n     - Differential pressure switch for minimum and maximum gas pressure.\n     - Differential pressure switch for burner air and vacuum.\n     - Temperature monitoring systems.\n     - Drum rotation status.\n\n4. **Ignition Process Verification:**\n   - Ensure the ignition process has been properly initiated. The system will attempt to ignite twice:\n     - First attempt: If unsuccessful, it automatically retries.\n     - Second attempt: If this also fails, the system triggers a malfunction switch-off.\n\n5. **Troubleshooting Steps:**\n   - After a malfunction switch-off, reset the system:\n     1. Acknowledge the malfunction via the control panel.\n     2. Verify all monitoring systems are in the correct operational state.\n     3. Restart the ignition sequence manually.\n\n**Next Steps / Checks:**\n- **Inspect Gas Supply:** Ensure the customer-supplied gas line is correctly connected with an equipotential bonding device.\n- **Check for Obstructions:** Clear any obstructions in the gas flow or burner area.\n- **Consult a Specialist:** If the fault persists, consult an authorized service technician for further diagnostics.\n\n**\u26a0\ufe0f Never operate the dryer in a room with chemical cleaning machines, as this can cause corrosion and damage.**\n\nUser: where is the ignition switch\n\nAssistant: To locate the ignition switch on a Kannegiesser dryer, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Access the Control Panel:**\n   - The ignition switch is typically integrated into the main control panel of the dryer.\n\n2. **Identify the Ignition Controls:**\n   - Look for a section labeled for ignition or burner controls. This may include buttons or switches specifically for starting the ignition process.\n\n3. **Check the Manual for Specific Location:**\n   - If the location is not immediately obvious, refer to the dryer\u2019s specific manual for a diagram or description of the ignition switch location.\n\n**Next Steps / Checks:**\n- **Ensure Power Supply:** Verify that the main power switch is turned on and the emergency stop is reset.\n- **Follow Safety Protocols:** Make sure all safety protocols are followed when accessing electrical components.\n\nIf you are unable to locate the ignition switch, please provide the specific model number of the dryer for more detailed assistance.",
